# Car Dealership Management System

A simple, console-based application for managing a small car dealership's inventory and sales, written in C++. This project was created as a demonstration of basic data structures and program flow in C++, for FYP of Programming Fundamentals.

## ðŸš¨ WARNING: Educational Use Only ðŸš¨

This program is intended strictly for educational purposes and as a portfolio piece. It is **NOT** suitable for use in a real-world, production environment. It contains several significant security vulnerabilities and uses non-standard, platform-dependent code.

Key issues include:

* **Critical Security Risk:** The program uses the `gets()` function, which is highly insecure and can lead to buffer overflows, a critical security vulnerability.
* **Undefined Behavior:** The use of `fflush(stdin)` is not defined by the C++ standard. Its behavior is unpredictable across different compilers and operating systems.
* **No Data Persistence:** All inventory and financial data are stored in memory and will be **permanently lost** when the program is closed. There is no database or file-saving mechanism as of now.
* **Hardcoded Credentials:** The administrator login credentials are hardcoded directly into the source code, which is an extremely insecure practice.
* **Fixed Capacity:** The inventory is limited to a maximum of 20 cars due to the use of a fixed-size array.
* **Lack of Input Validation:** The program has minimal input validation and may crash if unexpected data is entered (e.g., text instead of a number).

## Features

The application provides a command-line menu with the following capabilities:

### General Features
* **Display Inventory:** View all available or all sold cars.
* **Detailed View:** Get a comprehensive breakdown of a specific car by its ID, including engine/chassis numbers, condition notes, import details, and maintenance history.
* **Search:** Find cars by their unique Vehicle ID or by their make and model.
* **Sort:** Sort the list of available cars by price, make, ID, or model year.
* **Sales Tracking:** Mark a car as sold, record the buyer's name, sale price, and automatically calculate the profit or loss on the transaction.

### Admin-Only Features
*(Requires login with hardcoded credentials)*

* **Inventory Management:** Add new cars to the inventory or permanently remove existing ones.
* **Update Records:** Modify a car's mileage, color, or condition notes.
* **Maintenance Logs:** Add new maintenance records (including date, description, and cost) to a car's history.
* **Financial Reporting:**
    * View a summary sales report with total revenue and net profit/loss.
    * Display the single most and least profitable sales.
    * Generate an overall financial report showing cash on hand, the value of the current inventory, and total assets.
* **Delete Inventory:** A function to wipe the entire inventory (for demonstration purposes).

## How to Compile and Run

You will need a C++ compiler, such as G++, to build and run this project.

1.  **Save the Code:** Save the code in a file named `FYP.cpp`.

2.  **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
    ```bash
    g++ FYP.cpp -o dealership_manager
    ```

3.  **Run:** Execute the compiled program:
    * On Windows:
        ```bash
        dealership_manager.exe
        ```
    * On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        ./dealership_manager
        ```
